# ML Study

This repo is my ongoing work for studying Machine Learning.

## Python

The notebook code is mainly from Sebastian Raschka et al.'s book called Hands-On Machine Learning with Pytorch.
I will follow the tutorial code attached in the book and may or may not tweak some settings around to play with the results.

## Theoretical stuff

I am also brushing up on the theoretical side with the neural network series from Andrej Kapathy. I have followed the makemore series end to end but might need some time to make a detailed report on the in4 I got.
